== Related Tables Extension (Normative)

=== Extension Title

Related Tables

=== Introduction

This extension provides a mechanism for associating tables with existing feature or attribute tables in a GeoPackage. One use case for this extension is to associate multimedia content with features. Examples where this could be used include the following:

* Photographs
* Audio or Video files
* PDFs

This extension is based on of the `compusult_extrelations1` extension developed by http://compusult.net[Compusult].

This extension is the subject of the OGC GeoPackage (GPKG) Related Tables Extension Interoperability Experiment (GPKG-RTE IE).

=== Extension Author

GeoPackage SWG (no author name until adopted by OGC)

=== Extension Name or Template

`related_tables` (If this extension is adopted by OGC, then `gpkg_related_tables` will be named as an alias.)

=== Extension Type

New requirement dependent on http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#features[Clause 2.1] and http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#attributes[Clause 2.4].

=== Applicability

This extension defines a relationship between feature tables and aspatial tables that hold related media.

=== Scope

read-write

=== Requirements (Normative)

==== Table Definitions
[[gpkgext_relations]]
===== Relations
[[r1]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 1
====
A GeoPackage that complies with this extension SHALL contain a `gpkgext_relations` table or view as per <<gpkgext_relations_table>> and <<gpkgext_relations_sql>>.
====

[[gpkgext_relations_table]]
.Extended Relations Table Definition
[cols=",,,,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Column Name |Column Type |Column Description |Null |Default |Key
|`id`|INTEGER|Autoincrement primary key|no||PK
|`primary_table_name`|TEXT|Name of the table containing the features or attributes|no||
|`primary_column`|TEXT|Name of the primary key column in `primary_table_name` |no||
|`foreign_table_name`|TEXT|Name of the table containing the media|no||
|`foreign_column`|TEXT|Name of the foreign key column in `foreign_table_name` used as the foreign key to join with `primary_table_name` on the `primary_column` |no||
|`relation_name`|TEXT|Name of the relation ('media' for this extension)|no||
|=======================================================================

===== User Defined Media
[[r2]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 2
====
A GeoPackage that complies with this extension SHALL contain one or more user-defined media tables or views as per <<gpkg_user_defined_media_table>>. These tables MAY contain other columns.
====

[[gpkg_user_defined_media_table]]
.User Defined Media Table Definition
[cols=",,,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Column Name |Column Type |Column Description |Null |Key
|`id`|INTEGER	|Autoincrement primary key|no|PK
|`data`|BLOB	|Multimedia content|no|
|`content_type`|TEXT	|mime_type of data|no|
|_foreign_column_|TEXT	|foreign key as defined in <<gpkgext_relations_table>>|yes|FK
|=======================================================================

==== Table Values
===== `gpkg_extensions`
[[r3]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 3
====
A GeoPackage that complies with this extension SHALL contain rows in the `gpkg_extensions` table as described in <<gpkg_extensions_records>>. There SHALL be a row for `gpkgext_relations`.
====

[[gpkg_extensions_records]]
.Extensions Table Record
[cols=",,,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|table_name|column_name|extension_name|definition|scope
|`gpkgext_relations`|null|`related_tables`|TBD|`read-write`
|=======================================================================

===== Extended Relations
[[r4]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 4
====
For each row in `gpkgext_relations` there SHALL be a table or view of the name referenced in `primary_table_name` and that table SHALL have an entry in `gpkg_contents`.
====

[[r5]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 5
====

For each row in `gpkgext_relations` there SHALL be a table or view of the name referenced in `foreign_table_name` and that table SHALL have an entry in `gpkg_contents` with a `data_type` of 'attributes' and that table SHALL be a user-defined media table as defined by <<gpkg_user_defined_media_table>>.

====

[[r6]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 6
====
For any user-defined media table, as referenced in `gpkgext_relations`, if the value of its `foreign_column` (as specified in <<gpkgext_relations_table>>) is not null, the corresponding user-defined primary table (specified by `gpkgext_relations`) SHALL contain at least one a row with a value in its `primary_column` (specified by `gpkgext_relations`) equal to the value in the user-defined media table `foreign_column`.
====
For example:

* `gpkgext_relations` contains a row with:
** `primary_table_name` of 'features'
** `primary_column` of `relation_column`
** `foreign_table_name` of 'media'
** `foreign_column` of 'relation_column'
** `relation_name` of 'media'

.features
|=======================================================================
|feature_id|primary_column|
|1|7|
|2|7|
|3|8|
|=======================================================================

.media
|=======================================================================
|id|data|content_type|foreign_column
|17|<BLOB>|image/png|7
|18|<BLOB>|image/png|8
|19|<BLOB>|image/png|8
|=======================================================================

For each row of media with a non-null foreign_column, there must be at least one row in features with a matching id in the  primary_column.

It is important to note that this allows for many-to-many, one-to-many and many-to-one relationships between features and related media.
