== Conformance
This standard defines requirements for specialised attribute tables (containing information such as multimedia content to be stored in a GeoPackage, or simple attributes) and mapping tables to relate information in separate tables, along with metadata to describe those tables and the relationships between them.

Conformance with this standard shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in Annex A (normative) of this document. The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in the OGC Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures and the OGC Compliance Testing web sitefootnote:[http://www.opengeospatial.org/cite[www.opengeospatial.org/cite]].
