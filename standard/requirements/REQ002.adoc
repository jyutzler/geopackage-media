|*Requirement 2 â€“ gpkgext_relations Row* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE}|/req/table-defs/extensions-gerr +
 +

A GeoPackage that contains a row in the `gpkg_extensions` table for `gpkgext_relations` SHALL contain at least one related table relationship.
 {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
|===

[WARNING]
====
The intent of this requirement is that a GeoPackage shall not declare the Related Tables Extension unless it is used within the GeoPackage. As a consequence, if all rows are removed from  `gpkgext_relations`, that table must be dropped and all references to the extension must be removed from `gpkg_extensions` as well. However, because a related tables schema may be established without any data, empty user-defined mapping tables and/or related data tables are permitted.
